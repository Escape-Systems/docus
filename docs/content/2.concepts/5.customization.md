description: Learn how to override built-in components in Docus to customize
  your documentation.
---

Docus is built on top of Nuxt 3 which offers a flexible component layer system that allows you to override some part of the UI by redefining specific components in your own app. This makes it easy to fully customize the visual appearance and behavior of your documentation without touching the core theme.

To override a component, simply create a Vue file with the same name in the `components/` directory. Docus will automatically use your version instead of the default one.

## App Header

You can customize different parts of the header by overriding the following components:

### `AppHeaderLogo`

To replace the default logo in the header, create the `components/AppHeaderLogo.vue` file. Your component will replace the default one provided by Docus theme.

## Docs

You can also customize header and both asides of the documentation pages.

### `DocsHeaderRight`

In the header right side of your documentation page, Docus default behaviour is displaying a dropdown with quick actions related to the current page’s Markdown source. It allows the reader of the documentation to:

- **Copy a direct link** to the raw `.md` file to the clipboard.
- **View the Markdown source** in a new browser tab.
- **Open the page’s content in ChatGPT or Claude**, pre-filled with a prompt to analyze the Markdown file.

These actions are especially useful for contributors, readers, or AI-assisted workflows.

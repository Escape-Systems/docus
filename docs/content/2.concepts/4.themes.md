# Themes

Docus use Nuxt UI under the hood, you can customize all Nuxt UI components with the ui key provided by Nuxt UI.

## Design system

Docus with Nuxt UI extends Tailwind CSS's theming capabilities, providing a flexible design system with pre-configured color aliases based on [Tailwind CSS colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#color-palette-reference).

These colors are used to style the components but also to generate the `color` props.

### Configuration

You can configure these color aliases at runtime in your [`app.config.ts`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/app-config#app-config-file) file under the `ui.colors` key, allowing for dynamic theme customization without requiring an application rebuild:

```ts [app.config.ts]
export default defineAppConfig({
  ui: {
    colors: {
      primary: 'blue',
      neutral: 'zinc'
    }
  }
})
```

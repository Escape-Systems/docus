Welcome to **Docus**, a fully integrated documentation solution built with [Nuxt UI Pro](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro){rel="nofollow"}.

## What is Docus? :rocket:

Docus is a theme based on the [UI Pro documentation template](https://docs-template.nuxt.dev/){rel="nofollow"}. While the visual style comes ready out of the box, your focus should be on writing content using the Markdown and [MDC syntax](https://content.nuxt.com/docs/files/markdown#mdc-syntax){rel="nofollow"} provided by [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com){rel="nofollow"}.

We use this theme across all our Nuxt module documentations, including:

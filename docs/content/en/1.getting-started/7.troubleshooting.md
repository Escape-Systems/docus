## `pnpm` issues

If you encounter build or dev errors when using `pnpm`, especially related to `better-sqlite3` dependency, you might need to approve certain packages for building.

Run the following command to approve packages for building:

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm approve build
```

When prompted, select `better-sqlite3` and `sharp` from the list of packages to approve it for building.

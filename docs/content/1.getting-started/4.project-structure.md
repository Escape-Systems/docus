Docus provides a ready-to-use [documentation website starter](https://github.com/nuxt-themes/docus/tree/feat/docus-v2/.starter).

This is the minimal directory structure to get an up and running Docus website.

```bash
content/
  index.md
public/
  favicon.ico
package.json
```

### `content/` directory

This is where you [write pages](/concepts/edition) in Markdown.

### `public/` directory

Files contained within the `public/` directory are served at the root and are not modified by the build process of your documentation. This is where you can locate your medias.

### `package.json`

This file contains all the dependencies and scripts for your application. The `package.json` of a Docus application si really minimal and looks like:

```json [package.json]
{
  "name": "docus-starter",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "docus dev",
    "build": "docus build"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@larbish/docus": "latest"
  }
}
```

## `app/` directory

*This folder is not mandatory to start a Docus application.*

Docus is using Nuxt and the [new directory structure](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/upgrade#new-directory-structure) provided by the [compatibility version 4 .]() All files related to front app code goes in `app/` for cleaner organization and better IDE performance.

### `app.config.ts`

This is where you can [configure Docus](/concepts/configuration) to fit your branding, handle SEO and adapt links and socials.

::prose-tip{to="/concepts/nuxt"}
Docus uses a layer system, you can go further and use any feature or file of a classical Nuxt project from `nuxt.config.ts` to `app/components` or `server/` directory.
